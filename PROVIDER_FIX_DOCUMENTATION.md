# Provider Context Fix - Overall Assessment Screen

## Problem
When navigating from Audit Results to Overall Assessment screen, the app was throwing a `ProviderNotFoundException` error:
```
Could not find the correct Provider<AuditResultsViewModel> above this Consumer<AuditResultsViewModel> Widget
```

## Root Cause
The `AuditResultsViewModel` was provided locally in the `AuditResultsScreen` using `MultiProvider`, but when navigating to `OverallAssessmentScreen` with a new `MaterialPageRoute`, that Provider context was lost because:

1. **Providers are "scoped"** - they only exist within their widget tree
2. **New routes create new contexts** - `MaterialPageRoute` creates a new widget tree without the original Provider
3. **Consumer requires Provider** - The `OverallAssessmentScreen` uses `Consumer<AuditResultsViewModel>` but the Provider wasn't available in the new route's context

## Solution
Modified the navigation in both audit results screens to preserve the Provider context by wrapping the destination screen with the same `MultiProvider`:

### Before (Broken):
```dart
void _navigateToOverallAssessment(AuditReport report) {
  Navigator.push(
    context,
    MaterialPageRoute(
      builder: (context) => OverallAssessmentScreen(
        contractName: widget.contractName,
        fileName: widget.fileName,
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

### After (Fixed):
```dart
void _navigateToOverallAssessment(AuditReport report) {
  Navigator.push(
    context,
    MaterialPageRoute(
      builder: (context) => MultiProvider(
        providers: [
          ChangeNotifierProvider.value(value: _resultsViewModel),
          ChangeNotifierProvider.value(value: _mainViewModel),
        ],
        child: OverallAssessmentScreen(
          contractName: widget.contractName,
          fileName: widget.fileName,
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

## Files Modified
1. `/lib/features/presentation/pages/Audit/Views/audit_results_screen.dart`
2. `/lib/features/presentation/pages/Audit/Views/audit_results_screen_refactored.dart`

## Key Concepts
- **Provider.value**: Uses the existing ViewModel instances instead of creating new ones
- **Context Preservation**: Ensures the same Provider context is available in the new route
- **Shared State**: Both screens now share the same ViewModel instances and data

## Result
✅ Navigation to Overall Assessment screen now works correctly  
✅ Real data from AuditResultsViewModel is available in the Overall Assessment screen  
✅ No ProviderNotFoundException errors  
✅ Maintains MVVM clean architecture pattern
