✅ **Real Data Integration**: 
- Connected to AuditResultsViewModel using Consumer pattern
- Displays real data from AuditReport entity
- Dynamic vulnerability counts by severity
- Real gas optimization suggestions

✅ **Clean Architecture**: 
- Maintained MVVM pattern
- Proper separation of concerns
- Reactive UI updates through Provider

### 2. Overall Assessment Screen (overall_assessment_screen.dart)
✅ **Clean Layout**: Redesigned to match provided screenshot with:
- Progress indicator showing current step (4/4 - Assessment)
- Risk assessment card with dynamic risk level calculation
- Gas optimization assessment card
- Priority-based recommendations section
- Action buttons for navigation and report download

✅ **Dynamic Content**: 
- Risk levels calculated from real vulnerability data (Critical/High/Medium/Low/Secure)
- Gas optimization levels based on suggestion count
- Real-time assessment messages
- Priority recommendations based on actual findings

✅ **MVVM Integration**:
